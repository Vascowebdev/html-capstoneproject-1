<h1> Leisure Activities</h1>
<p>
    Outside of web development, I enjoy staying active and exploring new experiences. I’m a big fan of football and basketball, whether it's watching games, analyzing plays, or debating matchups with friends.
    I also make time for the gym, pushing myself to stay fit and energized. 
    Trying new food is another passion of mine—I love discovering different cuisines and finding hidden gem restaurants.

    I’m always up for a good time with friends, whether it’s a night out, a weekend road trip, or just kicking back and enjoying great conversations. 
    Traveling is something I truly enjoy, as it gives me the chance to experience different cultures, meet new people, and create unforgettable memories. 
    I also have an interest in technology and creativity, whether it’s exploring new software, brainstorming innovative ideas, or finding ways to blend tech with my personal interests. 
    My curiosity and excitement for life keep me open to new challenges and adventures, making every day an opportunity to learn and grow.
